This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.       

Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.        

Your expected outputs: an array of positive integers from 1 to n        

Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.
