You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

你需要編寫一個可以反轉字串單字的函式，一個單字也能是一個空字串。如果這不夠清楚，這裡是一些範例。

輸入可能有尾隨空格，你還需要忽略不必要的空格。
```
reverse("Hello World") === "World Hello"
reverse("Hi There.") === "There. Hi"

```
