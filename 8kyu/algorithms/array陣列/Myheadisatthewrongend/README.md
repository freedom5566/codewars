# Description:

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!


Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).



Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!

簡單來說他會給一個陣列

陣列有3個值

['頭','身體','尾巴']

但所有的測試範例都是只有頭跟尾巴會錯位，身體永遠在中間！

所以我們只要交換頭尾就可以了
